<h1>ALERT! <h5> infinite tokens is still in BETA!

infinite tokens is a project started and inspired by two of our workers (kris - kristheamazing2) and (flynn - profile not made)

infinite tokens plans on giving users infinite tokens in blooket allthough this seems impossible due to blooket having a daily token limit.

the closest we can get to creating a infinite tokens hack/code is by creating a auto hack which will automatically give you glixzzy's token hack, but
that hack is very inconveniant since you would need to have the blooket tab with that hack injected for atleast 7 days just to get a few thousand tokens,
so we are not releasing this hack.

we are still planning on a infinite token hack but don't count on it coming out for another year.

for the meanwhile we will be uploading our progress in the infinite token folder.



(ps.if you have any suggestions of how to do a infinite token hack contact us in the issues tab)
